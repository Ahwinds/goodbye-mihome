#Goodbye MiHome#

Break into API of smart home products from Xiaomi and wrap sensors data to cozy web interface.

###Currently supported devices###

- Temperature and humidity sensor: collect data, show current value and line charts
- Gateway LED (change color, set brightness, toggle status)

The list will expand as I receive more Xiaomi devices and make plugins for them. Feel free to write your plugins if you have other devices/sensors.

###Background images for web interface###

To make web interface even better, you could put your favorite images into `web/static/img/bg/` directory. Background image changes every 5 minutes (hovewer, you could tweak the interval in js file).
